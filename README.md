# jquery.article-progress

A lightweight jQuery plugin to indicate the reading progress of the main article. It supports three different types:

1. "width" -> adjusts the width of an element (progress bar mode)
2. "text" -> displays the progress as percentage
3. "circle" -> shows a pie chart with the progress (can be transformed in to a donut!)

## How to Use

1. Add **jquery.article-progress.js** to your project.

2. Initalize by calling **$('article').articleProgress();**
